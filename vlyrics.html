"Family Portrait"<br>
<br><br>
Uh, uh, some deep shit, uh, uh <br>
<br><br>
Momma please stop cryin, I can't stand the<br> sound <br>
Your pain is painful and its tearin' me down <br>
I hear glasses breakin as I sit up in my bed <br>
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you <br>
said <br>
<br><br>
You fight about money, bout me and my brother <br>
And this I come home to, this is my shelter <br>
It ain't easy growin up in World War III <br>
Never knowin what love could be, you'll see <br>
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done<br>
my family <br>
<br><br>
Can we work it out? Can we be a family? <br>
I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything <br>
Can we work it out? Can we be a family? <br>
I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't<br>
leave <br>

Daddy please stop yellin, I can't stand the sound<br>
<br><br>
Make mama stop cryin, cuz I need you around <br>
My mama she loves you, no matter what she says<br>
its true <br>
I know that she hurts you, but remember I love<br>
you, too <br>
<br><br>
I ran away today, ran from the noise, ran away <br>
Don't wanna go back to that place, but don't have<br>
no choice, no way <br>
It ain't easy growin up in World War III <br>
Never knowin what love could be, well I've seen<br> 
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my<br>
family <br>
<br><br>
Can we work it out? Can we be a family? <br>
I promise I'll be better, Mommy I'll do anything <br>
Can we work it out? Can we be a family? <br>
I promise I'll be better, Daddy please don't<br>
leave <br>
<br><br>
In our family portrait, we look pretty happy <br>
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes<br>
naturally <br>
I don't wanna have to split the holidays <br>
I don't want two addresses <br>
I don't want a step-brother anyways <br>
And I don't want my mom to have to change her<br>
last name <br>
<br><br>
In our family portrait we look pretty happy <br>
We look pretty normal, let's go back to that <br>
