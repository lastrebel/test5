<br />
I find shelter in this way<br />
Under cover, hide away<br />
Can you hear when I say<br />
I have never felt this way<br />
  <br /><br />
Maybe I had said something that was wrong<br />
Can I make it better with the lights turned on<br />
Maybe I had said something that was wrong<br />
Can I make it better with the lights turned on<br />
  <br /><br />
Oh [x4]<br />
  <br /><br />
Can I be, was I there<br />
Felt so crystal in the air<br />
I still want to drown whenever you leave<br />
Please teach me gently on how to breathe<br />
  <br /><br />
And I'll cross oceans like never before<br />
So you can feel the way I feel it too<br />
And I'll send images back at you<br />
So you can see the way I feel it too<br />
  <br /><br />
Maybe I had said something that was wrong<br />
Can I make it better with the lights turned on<br />
Maybe I had said something that was wrong<br />
Can I make it better with the lights turned on<br />
  <br /><br />
Oh [x8]<br />

[Verse 1]<br />
Break down, tears fall to the ground<br />
Tell myself: "Damnit, nothing can be found"<br />
When you're a fighter<br />
You're a fighter<br />
You're a fighter, fight on baby<br />
<br /><br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Some days I'm sure I'll lose to fate<br />
Some days I cannot find my faith<br />
But I just fight on<br />
I just fight on<br />
I just fight on baby, baby<br />
<br /><br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
And I am a wounded warrior<br />
And now that the enemy is closing in<br />
I am a wounded warrior<br />
Looking for someone to let me in<br />
<br /><br />
[Chorus]<br />
Black and blue, I'm begging you<br />
Take me in, I'm surrendering<br />
Black and blue, but if I'm with you<br />
If I'm with you, I will live to fight on through<br />
<br /><br />
[Verse 3]<br />
I'll let go, walking into the unknown<br />
If I surrender, if I lay my arms down<br />
Am I a fighter?<br />
Am I a fighter?<br />
Cause I've been fighting so long baby<br />
<br /><br />
[Pre-Chorus]<br />
And I am a wounded warrior<br />
And now that the enemy is closing in<br />
I am a wounded warrior<br />
Looking for someone to let me in<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Black and blue, I'm begging you<br />
Take me in, I'm surrendering<br />
Black and blue, but if I'm with you<br />
If I'm with you, I will live to fight on through<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
I am a wounded warrior<br />
Now that the enemy is closing in<br />
I am a wounded warrior<br />
Looking for someone to let me in<br />
<br /><br />
I am a wounded warrior<br />
Now that the enemy is closing in<br />
Close and in<br />
Looking for someone to let me in, oh!<br />
<br /><br />
[Chorus x2]<br />
Black and blue, I'm begging you<br />
Take me in, I'm surrendering<br />
Black and blue, but if I'm with you<br />
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight on through<br />

<br>
I had given up<br>
I didn’t know who to trust<br>
So I designed a shell<br>
Kept me from heaven and hell<br>
And I had hit a low<br>
Was all I let myself know<br>
Yeah I had locked my heart<br>
I was imprisoned by dark<br>
<br>
You found me dressed in black<br>
Hiding way up at the back<br>
Life had broken my heart into pieces<br>
You took my hand in yours<br>
You started breaking down my walls<br>
And you covered my heart in kisses<br>
I thought life passed me by<br>
Missed my tears, ignored my cries<br>
Life had broken my heart, my spirit<br>
And then you crossed my path<br>
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh<br>
Then you covered my heart in kisses<br>
<br>
I was down for the count<br>
I was down I was out<br>
And I had lost it all<br>
'Cause I was scared, I was torn<br>
And I took to the night<br>
I’d given in to the fight<br>
And I slipped further down<br>
I felt like I had drowned<br>
<br>
You found me dressed in black<br>
Hiding way up at the back<br>
Life had broken my heart into pieces<br>
You took my hand in yours<br>
You started breaking down my walls<br>
And you covered my heart in kisses<br>
I thought life passed me by<br>
Missed my tears, ignored my cries<br>
Life had broken my heart, my spirit<br>
And then you crossed my path<br>
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh<br>
Then you covered my heart in kisses<br>
<br>
I was hopeless and broken<br>
You opened the door for me<br>
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in<br>
And now I see<br>
That you do for the wounded<br>
What they couldn't seem to<br>
You set them free<br>
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key<br>
<br>
You found me dressed in black<br>
Hiding way up at the back<br>
Life had broken my heart into pieces<br>
You took my hand in yours<br>
You started breaking down my walls<br>
And you covered my heart in kisses<br>
I thought life passed me by<br>
Missed my tears, ignored my cries<br>
Life had broken my heart, my spirit<br>
And then you crossed my path<br>
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh<br>
Then you covered my heart in kisses<br>
<br>
Covered my heart in kisses<br>
